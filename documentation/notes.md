# Documentation Notes

> Providing additional human-readable documentation (beyond the required artifacts like a README) to implementers and future maintainers of the IEPD is encouraged.  This may include artifacts like UML diagrams, a spreadsheet or document with information about the original data requirements, a mapping spreadsheet that captures how the original data requirements map to the NIEM subset and new extension components, slides, Word documents, etc.
