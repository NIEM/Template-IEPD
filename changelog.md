# Change  log

> The example below shows version history information for the IEPD template itself and should be replaced.  There is no set format for a NIEM IEPD change log and the file can be text, document, spreadsheet.  Include the kind of information that will be helpful to IEPD implementers as they support the updated IEPD.

## Version 3.0 (2014-10-20)

- Initial Release corresponding to MPD Specification 3.0.

## Version 4.0 (2017-09-05)

- Updated the IEPD extension schema, NIEM subset schemas, and sample XML instance to use the NIEM 4.0 release.
- Updated README.md
- Added a conformance report generated by ConTesA.
- Note that the MPD catalog itself is still based on the 3.0.1 NIEM-MPD specification, which uses NIEM 3.0.

## Version 5.0 (2022-01-31)

- Updated the IEPD extension schema, NIEM subset schemas, and sample XML instance to use the NIEM 5.0 release.
- Updated the template to use the [5.0 version](https://niem.github.io/MPD-Spec/v5.0/niem-iepd-spec.html) of the IEPD specification, including updating and renaming `mpd-catalog.xml` as `iepd-catalog.xml`.
- Moved general IEPD template information out of README.md and into a separate default [docs branch](https://github.com/NIEM/Template-IEPD/tree/docs) for the repo.
- Updated the conformance assertion template to better specify how various artifacts can be checked for conformance.
