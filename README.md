# Template IEPD

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NIEM/Template-IEPD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NIEM/Template-IEPD)

This is a template IEPD for NIEM 4.0. It is designed to be a starting point for IEPD creators.

IEPDs built from this template should follow the [NIEM-MPD 3.0.1 specification](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html)

The NIEM-MPD specification defines the contents and structure of IEPDs including metadata, XML Schema documents, and documentation.

[Example IEPDs and supporting artifacts](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/) are available for further reference.

## This template IEPD contains

1. [NIEM schema subset](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_4.2)

    - NIEM subset schemas contain user-selected components from a NIEM release.
    - Use the NIEM [Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT)](http://tools.niem.gov/niemtools/) to create a subset for an IEPD based on local requirements.
    - The NIEM subset should also include the `wantlist.xml` file generated by the SSGT so that the subset may be easily reloaded and updated for a future version of the IEPD.

2. [NIEM extension schema](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_4.3)

    - IEPD extension schemas define the components that are needed for an exchange that are not found in NIEM.
    - A NIEM 4.x extension schema must contain a conformance target identifier in the schema declaration as follows:
      ```ct:conformanceTargets="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/4.0/#ExtensionSchemaDocument"```

3. [Catalog file](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.1)

    - A MPD catalog defines metadata for an IEPD.  It includes basic information about the IEPD itself, including point of contact information, and information about the artifacts in the package.
    - See [Appendix B](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#appendix_B) of the MPD Specification for an example.
    - See [mpd-catalog-3.0.xsd](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/xsd-mpd-catalog/mpd-catalog-3.0.xsd) for the XML Schema that defines this file.

4. [README](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.4)

    - A ReadMe file is documentation that should describe an IEPD, including such information as its purpose, scope, business value, exchange information, typical senders and receivers, and the artifacts in the IEPD.

5. [Change Log](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.3)

    - A change log describes the changes applied to an IEPD since its previous version.
    - For the initial version of an IEPD, the change log may simply contain the release date.

6. [Conformance Assertion](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.7)

    - A conformance assertion should include information such as if the IEPD is NIEM conformant, list any known issues or exceptions, and describe what tools or processes were used to determine conformance.
    - Required checks to assert NIEM conformance:
      - Check that IEPD extension schemas (XML only) are conformant to the automated NIEM [Naming and Design Rules (NDR)](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/) using the [Conformance Testing Assistant (ConTesA)](https://tools.niem.gov/contesa/).
        - ConTesA will produce a conformance report that can be included with the IEPD.  The results can be referenced by the conformance assertion.
        - Note that all IEPD extension schemas must have a conformance target identifier, as specified above, in order for ConTesA to work.
      - Check that the IEPD package itself is conformant to the [MPD Specification](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html).  This is a manual process, but [Appendix E](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#appendix_E) in the MPD specification provides a basic checklist of best practices.
    - See [Appendix D](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#appendix_D) of the MPD Specification for an example of a conformance assertion.
