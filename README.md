# Template IEPD

This repo provides templates for different versions of [NIEM IEPDs](https://niem.github.io/reference/iepd/).  This can be used as a starting point for IEPD developers.

The NIEM-MPD specification defines the contents and structure of IEPDs including metadata, XML Schema documents, and documentation.

## Download the template

### 5.0 template

The 5.0 template ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/NIEM/Template-IEPD/tree/niem-5.0) or [download zip](https://github.com/NIEM/Template-IEPD/archive/refs/tags/niem-5.0.zip)) is based on the NIEM Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD) Specification, [version 5.0](https://niem.github.io/MPD-Spec/v5.0/niem-iepd-spec.html).  This can be used for IEPDs based on a NIEM release in the 5.x series (5.0, 5.1, or 5.2).

The MPD specification was renamed and simplified during the NIEM 5.0 release to focus specifically on IEPDs.  References to other kinds of model packages were removed.  The IEPD catalog has been updated to replace the use of "MPD" with "IEPD" in property and type names.

### 4.0 template

The 4.0 template ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/NIEM/Template-IEPD/tree/niem-4.0) or [download zip](https://github.com/NIEM/Template-IEPD/archive/refs/tags/niem-4.0.zip)) is based on the NIEM Model Package Description (MPD) Specification, [version 3.0.1](https://niem.github.io/MPD-Spec/v3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html). This can be used for IEPDs based on a NIEM release in the 4.x series (4.0, 4.1, or 4.2).

The changes from the 3.0 version are minor since the MPD spec was not updated for NIEM 4.0, but the NIEM subset and MPD catalog were updated to the NIEM 4.0 release.

### 3.0 template

The 3.0 template ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/NIEM/Template-IEPD/tree/niem-3.0) or [download zip](https://github.com/NIEM/Template-IEPD/archive/refs/tags/niem-3.0.zip)) is based on the NIEM Model Package Description (MPD) Specification, [version 3.0.1](https://niem.github.io/MPD-Spec/v3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html).  This can be used for IEPDs based on a NIEM release in the 3.x series (3.0, 3.1, or 3.2).

## Template contents

1. [NIEM subset schemas](https://niem.github.io/reference/iepd/artifacts/subset-schema/)

    - NIEM subset schemas contain user-selected components from a NIEM release.
    - Use the NIEM [Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT)](http://tools.niem.gov/niemtools/) to create a subset for an IEPD based on local requirements.
    - The NIEM subset should also include the `wantlist.xml` file generated by the SSGT so that the subset may be easily reloaded and updated for a future version of the IEPD.

2. [NIEM extension schema(s)](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_4.3)

    - IEPD extension schemas define the components that are needed for an exchange that are not found in NIEM.
    - NIEM schemas must declare a conformance target indicating which version and rule set of the [NIEM Naming and Design Rules (NDR)](https://niem.github.io/reference/specifications/ndr/) are applicable.  This informs conformance tools which set of NDR Schematron rules should be used for validation.  See [conformance targets](https://niem.github.io/reference/specifications/conformance-targets/) for more.

3. [MPD/IEPD Catalog file](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.1)

    - A MPD/IEPD catalog defines metadata for an IEPD.  It includes basic information about the IEPD itself, including point of contact information, and information about the artifacts in the package.
    - See the [IEPD Catalog](https://niem.github.io/reference/iepd/artifacts/iepd-catalog/) page under IEPD artifacts on niem.github.io for more.

4. [README](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.4)

    - A ReadMe file is documentation that should describe an IEPD, including such information as its purpose, scope, business value, exchange information, typical senders and receivers, and the artifacts in the IEPD.

5. [Change Log](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.3)

    - A change log describes the changes applied to an IEPD since its previous version.
    - For the initial version of an IEPD, the change log may simply contain the release date.

6. [Conformance Assertion](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.7)

    - A conformance assertion should include information such as if the IEPD is NIEM conformant, list any known issues or exceptions, and describe what tools or processes were used to determine conformance.
    - Check that IEPD extension schemas (XML only) are conformant to the automated NIEM [Naming and Design Rules (NDR)](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/) using the [Conformance Testing Assistant (ConTesA)](https://tools.niem.gov/contesa/).  A report can be downloaded from the tool and included in the IEPD.
      - Note that ConTesA only checks NIEM conformance of XML schemas, not the entire IEPD itself.
      - Note that all IEPD extension schemas must have a conformance target identifier, as specified above, in order for ConTesA to work.  Without it, ConTesA will not know which specific NDR rule set to use and no rules will be run.
    - Check that the full MPD / IEPD package is conformant to the [MPD / IEPD Specification](https://niem.github.io/reference/specifications/iepd/).  This is a manual process, but Appendix E of the [MPD Specification v3.0](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#appendix_E) or [IEPD Specification v5.0](https://niem.github.io/MPD-Spec/v5.0/niem-iepd-spec.html#appendix_E) provide a basic checklist of best practices.  A bigger [IEPD checklist](https://niem.github.io/reference/iepd/lifecycle/assemble-and-document/#iepd-review-checklist) is also available to use for manual conformance reviews.
    - See the [Conformance assertion](https://niem.github.io/reference/iepd/artifacts/#conformance-assertion) information on niem.github.io for information about ConTesA and the IEPD checklist.
