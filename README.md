# IEPD Name

> The following is general information about an IEPD Readme artifact and is included here for convenience.  Update the title with the actual IEPD name and replace the contents of this file with the actual description of the IEPD.

A readme artifact is mandatory for all IEPDs. Additional documentation can be included in an IEPD as desired, but a readme will serve as the common starting point and is the required minimum for human-readable documentation.

A readme should include information that describes the following:

- Purpose of the IEPD
- Scope of its deployment, usage, and information content
- Business value and rationale for developing it
- Type of information it is intended to exchange, in business terms
- Identification (or types) of senders and receivers
- Typical interactions between senders, receivers, and systems
- References to other documentation within the IEPD
- Links to external documents that may be needed to understand and implement the IEPD

The readme does not have a required file format. Word documents, text, and markdown are common formats.
